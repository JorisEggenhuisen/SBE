# SBE
Sediment Budget Estimator for deep sea depositional systems

## Info

This is version 1.0.0 of the Sediment Budget Estimator (SBE), which quantifies flow structure (velocity & sediment concentration) and sediment flux for turbidity currents flowing down submarine channels and canyons, and integrates this over time to estimate the sediment budget of a parameterised deep sea depositional system. The model is described in the publication:

## Set-up

The SBE is written to be executed in Matlab. Version 1.0.0 has been tested up to MATLAB [R2019a0]. It makes use of the function 'percentile', which is part of the Statistics Toolbox. The SBE consists of 5 -.m files:

-Run_SBE.m Is the script that executes the Sediment Budget Estimator.
-SimulationConditions.m The boundary condition ranges for the desired simulations are specified here.
-SimParamaters.m Declares some standard parameters and constants.
-VelCon.m This function returns the velocity and concentration profiels and the sediment flux.
-FlowDur.m This function returns the sediment budget.

Auxiliary -.m files:

- The folder 'Boundary Conditions' contains versions of 'SimulationConditions.m' that can be used to reproduce the results of Eggenhuisen et al. (2021).
- The folder 'Visualisations' contains example code that was use to produce the figures in Eggenhuisen et al. (2021). 

## Author information 

The Matlab code for the SBE was written by Joris Eggenhuisen & Mike Tilston. See Eggenhuisen et al. (2021) for a complete list of contributors to the scientific process.

## Potential Improvements 

Development potential:
- Facilitate single-flow parameterisation (deterministic instead of stochastic)
- Facilitate non-uniform sampling of boundary condition ranges (e.g. normal or log-normal distributions) 
- Auto-adjust 'steps' parameter to the boundary condition range.

## Changelog

A changelog file is available that documents the changes made between different versions.

## THE END (but hopefully TO BE CONTINUED)
